# NgRecipesPlanner

This project was created using **Angular** version 7.2.2, **Angular Material** modules and Angular **Flex Layout**.

It represents a simple menu where user can signup, login (via Firebase), then search and select a recipe in order to
add it to the menu for the week ahead.

The app can be seen [here](http://menu.albertomasia.it).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
